Developed a Python-based calibration tool to monitor PLC signals across various cooling systems in the steel plant.
This task was done manually before, I proposed an automated alternative to be integrated in the new expansion plant.
This tool Compared real-time values with setpoints to calculate deviations and flagged deviations beyond Â±1 to maintain system accuracy.
